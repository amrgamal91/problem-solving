/** ============================================= prototypical Inheritance  ===========================================================**/
// In traditional JavaScript, there is the concept of inheritance in a camouflage.
// It is by using a technique of prototyping. All the new class syntax you see in ES5, ES6 is just a syntactical sugar coating for the underlying prototypical OOP.
//Creating a class is done using a function in JavaScript.

//Here we are creating objects for the class (using new keyword).
//We can add methods for a given class(function) like this. Attach a class method like this.
Animal.prototype.shout = function() {
  console.log(this.name + "is " + this.sound + "ing...");
};

// Here you may get a doubt. There is no sound property in the class. Yes! there is hardly a sound property defined.
// That is intended to be passed by the child classes who inherits above class.
// In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved like this.
function Dog(name, type) {
  Animal.call(this, name, type);
  this.sound = "bow";
}

// I defined one more specific function called Dog. Here, in order to inherit the Animal class,
// we need to perform call function(we discussed it earlier) with passing this and other arguments.
// We can instantiate a German Shepard like this
var pet = Dog("germanShepard", animalGroups.MAMMAL);
console.log(pet); // returns Dog {name: "germanShepard", type: 1, sound: "bow"}

/**
 * We are not assigning name and type in the child function, we are calling super function Animal and setting the respective properties.
 * The pet is having the properties(name, type) of the parent. But what about the methods.
 * Are they inherited too? Let us see! */

pet.shout(); // Throws error

// What? why did that happen? It happens because we didn’t say JavaScript to inherit the parent class methods.
// How to fix that? // Link prototype chains
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
var pet = new Dog("germanShepard", animalGroups.MAMMAL);
// Now shout method is available
pet.shout(); // germanShepard is bowing...

// Now shout method is available. We can check what is the class of given object in JavaScript using the object.constructor function.
// Let us check what is the class of our pet.
pet.constructor; // returns Animal
// It is vague. The Animal is a parent class. But what type exactly is the pet? It is a Dog type. This occurs because of the constructor of Dog class.
Dog.prototype.constructor; // returns Animal

//It is Animal. We should set it to Dog class itself so that all instances(objects) of the class should give correct class name where it belongs to.
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
/*
    These four things you should remember about prototypical inheritance.
        - Class properties are bound using this
        - Class methods are bound using prototype object
        - To inherit properties, use call function passing this object
        - To inherit methods, use Object.create to link prototypes of parent and child
        - Always set child class constructor to itself for getting the right identity of its objects
    Note: These are things happens under the hood even with new class syntax. 
    Knowing these is valuable for your JS knowledge.
