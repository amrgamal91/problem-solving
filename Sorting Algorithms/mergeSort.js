/**
 * =================================  Merge Sort =================================
 * It all revolves around the idea that itâ€™s easier to sort two sorted arrays rather than one unsorted one.
 * Once we have our two sorted arrays we start comparing their items one by one and adding the smaller item in our result list

 * complexity : It's O(n * log(n)), not O(log(n)). As you've accurately surmised, the entire input must be iterated through,
 * and this must occur O(log(n)) times (the input can only be halved O(log(n)) times). n items iterated log(n) times gives O(n log(n)).
 * It's been proven that no comparison sort can operate faster than this.
 * Only sorts that rely on a special property of the input such as radix sort can beat this complexity.
 * The constant factors of mergesort are typically not that great though so algorithms with worse complexity can often take less time
